# CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Assignment Solutions (Winter 2016)

The course website: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/

Here are my solutions. I used the course notes, lecture videos and assignment code, which is made public for everyone (thank you to Stanford, and all teachers for this opportunity). I do not guarantee that my solutions are correct, so if you find any errors please let me know.

Probably you can find useful other repositories as:

I found very interesting this post on Batch Normalization
